- â€‹The three BioMOBS testdata files in 'json' format can be uploaded to a user's Arangodb database. When all three files are called in seperate files in the 'routes/api' endpoints, they will allow a try-out of this visual design. This data is analogue to the UK biobank application data but all data is synthetically generated for demonstration purposes and does not represent real individuals.

- The BioMOBS_stad.ipynb (python script) is the 'making of' file that shows how a toplogical STAD computation can be done on a cosine distance matrix and how the BioMOBS_testdata_edges can be stored in ArangoDB through the command line
