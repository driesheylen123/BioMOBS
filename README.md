# Intro
We designed BioMOBS, a multi-omics visual analytics workflow for biomolecular insight generation. This repository contains the code to perform the topological analyses and integrates with CKG (https://ckg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/INTRO.html) and MOBS (https://mobs.vercel.app/) to perform clinically relevant pathway analyses.

Users can find example data to load the applications in the data folder of this repository https://github.com/driesheylen123/BioMOBS/tree/master/data. All data is synthetically generated for demonstration purposes and does not represent real individuals. In order to apply the workflow upon their own data users can easily format their data at (https://biomobs.shinyapps.io/shiny/). Test data for a fast try-out of the formatting process is also available there.
## Running the app locally
This project is developped in the JavaScript framework [Svelte](https://svelte.dev). To run this application locally, clone the repository to a directory on your computer. *Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*

1. Open the terminal/command promt on your pc.
2. change the directory to the folder you want to store the application in.
```bash
cd Documents
```
3. Clone this GitHub repository into your folder.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/driesheylen123/BioMOBS-topological-analyses.git
```
4. Navigate to the cloned repository
```bash
cd Documents\BioMOBS-topological-analyses
```
5. Install all necessary dependencies. *Make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is installed on your device*
```bash
npm install
```
6. Run the application
```bash
npm run dev
```
7. Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). This is where you should see the app running once you have put the json files from  the BioMOBS-topological-analyses
/data folder into an ArangoDB database. Below is explained how you can connect your ArangoDB database to these scripts.



## Approach for database connection
- The database is defined in `src/lib/database.js`.
- The connection details (host, database name, username, password) are stored in a `.env` file at the root level. This file is _not_ put under source code control obviously, so you'll have to create this file every time you make a clone of this repo. The format of the file looks like this:

```
VITE_DB_URL=your_database_url
VITE_DB=your_database_name
VITE_USER=your_user
VITE_PASSWORD=your_password
```
Please insert the appropriate information to link with your data.

- The actual access through the data is defined in endpoints, defined in `routes/api` (OBSOLETE files). Typically, there are different endpoints for different datasets or types of data. For example, pointing to different tables in the database if this makes sense. These endpoints basically contain the AQL query to get the data from the database. TIP: while developing, check the contents of these endpoints by going to e.g. http://localhost:3000/api/datapoints.json.
- Any reshaping of the data (e.g. adding a `source` and `target` to edges if only `_from` and `_to` were defined) is done in the endpoints. Test data is available in the 'data/' folder of this repository. The json files there can be directly stored in a ArangoDB database and called in the endpoints for a try-out of this topological visual design. The 'data/BioMOBS_stad.ipynb' file shows how you can read-in your own data into your ArangoDB database to apply this toplogicial analyses visual upon.
